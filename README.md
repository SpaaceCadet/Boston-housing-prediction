# Boston-housing-prediction

- This is a trial of house price prediction , using the famous Boston housing dataset .
-  In this  notebook , i tried to fit a linear regression model to data , by exploring data , cleaning it , transforming variables , finding useful features for prediction , and the most 
important thing : respecting assumptions of linear  regression model .
-  i tried to explain each step of the code , with comments and markdowns .
- in the end i created other models in order to do some comparisons which one fits the best data and performs well on test set .
